# Datasciencegame

This data science competition between universities and research institutes around the globe was hosted by datasciencegame as an in-class kaggle challenge where I was the team leader of 3 fellow data science students. The challenge was based on Deezer's music streaming data with the task of predicting a user's probability of listening to a recommended song. Our final predictions consisted of a blend of gradient boosting models which placed us in front of other top universities such as University of Cambridge, Imperial College, Berkely, LSE.

Our approach was based on reducing the amount of data by deleting 75% of the provided samples which proved not to be necessary to gain good performance. Moreover, engineered features such as the days between listening and release date also proved to be powerful.
